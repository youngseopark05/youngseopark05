- 👋 Hi, I’m Youngseo Park (@youngseopark05), but you can feel free to call me Hannah!
- 👀 I’m interested in Web and Game Development/Design! (Otherwise, I'm still extremely intrigued by Music Theory, Film Analysis, Board Games, and Daredevil!)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, C#, Unity, and so much more!
- 💞️ I’m still a newbie, so I'm a bit reluctant to collaborate, but feel free to check out my first independent Python project [here](https://github.com/youngseopark05/smartspotifyplaylists)
